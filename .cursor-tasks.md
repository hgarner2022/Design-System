# Cursor Tasks

This file contains tasks and notes for the Cursor workspace.

## Fully Themed Design System Tasks

### Story: Project Scaffolding (Next.js + TypeScript)
- [ ] Initialize a new Next.js 13 project with TypeScript (e.g. via create-next-app) in the repository.
- [ ] Use the Next.js App Router (create an app/ directory with a basic layout and page) for the project structure.
- [ ] Enable strict TypeScript checking in tsconfig.json (no implicit any, strictNullChecks, etc.).
- [ ] Set up the base project structure, including directories like src/components/ for UI components and src/styles/ for global styles.
- [ ] Integrate the brand fonts Plus Jakarta Sans (for body text) and Petrona (for headings) into the project (e.g. via Next.js Google Fonts or an import in global CSS).
- [ ] Install essential dependencies: add Zustand (state management), Framer Motion (animations), and Vitest (testing) to the project.
- [ ] Verify the development server runs without errors and commit the initial scaffolding.

### Story: Tailwind v4 Configuration
- [ ] Install Tailwind CSS v4 and initialize the Tailwind config file (using npx tailwindcss init) for the Next.js app.
- [ ] Update tailwind.config.js to include all content paths (Next.js app or pages, components, and Storybook files) for purge/scan.
- [ ] Extend the Tailwind theme in the config: add the project's brand color (#4F46E5) as a custom color, and set up font families for sans (Plus Jakarta Sans) and serif (Petrona).
- [ ] Enable dark mode in Tailwind by setting darkMode: 'class' to allow theme toggling via a .dark class.
- [ ] Include Tailwind's base, components, and utilities in the global stylesheet (e.g. import tailwindcss/tailwind.css in _app.tsx or globals.css).
- [ ] Test Tailwind setup by adding a sample element (e.g. a header or button with Tailwind classes) to ensure styles are applied correctly in the app.

### Story: Storybook v8 Setup with Theme Toggle
- [ ] Install and initialize Storybook v8 in the project (generate the .storybook config directory and necessary files).
- [ ] Configure Storybook to work with Next.js and Tailwind: ensure that the Next.js framework is used and that global Tailwind CSS (and any global styles like fonts/theme) are loaded in Storybook's preview.
- [ ] Add Storybook scripts to package.json (e.g. "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006", and "build-storybook": "storybook build").
- [ ] Implement a theme toggle in Storybook for light/dark mode. Install and configure the storybook-dark-mode addon (or a similar theme switcher) so that a UI control in Storybook can toggle a .dark class on the preview iframe or apply a dark theme.
- [ ] Verify the Storybook UI loads correctly by running npm run storybook and ensure that toggling the theme switcher changes the appearance (e.g. background and text colors) according to the Tailwind dark mode classes.

### Story: Figma Design Tokens Integration
- [ ] Add the provided Figma design tokens JSON file (e.g. tokens/tokens.json) to the repository (this file contains the design system's color, spacing, and typography tokens).
- [ ] Set up an automated process to generate a CSS theme file from tokens.json. For example, write a Node script or use Style Dictionary to convert the design tokens into a src/styles/theme.css file containing CSS custom properties.
- [ ] In the token-to-CSS generation, create CSS variables for each token (e.g. --color-primary: #4F46E5 for the brand color, as well as variables for font sizes, spacing, etc. as defined in the tokens).
- [ ] If the design tokens file includes both light and dark mode values, ensure the generated CSS supports them (for instance, output :root variables for default theme and a .dark selector with overridden variables for dark theme values).
- [ ] Run the token build script (e.g. npm run build-theme) to produce the initial theme.css from the tokens, and include this file in the app's global styles (import it so that the CSS custom properties are available application-wide).
- [ ] Verify that the CSS custom properties are working by applying a token (e.g. using a var() in a test component's style or via Tailwind if integrated) and checking in the browser or Storybook.

### Story: Component Creation – Button and Input
- [ ] Create a Button component at src/components/ui/Button.tsx. Use a functional React component with "use client" at the top (since it will have interactive behavior). Define appropriate props (e.g. variant, size, disabled, etc.) for the Button.
- [ ] Style the Button using Tailwind CSS classes. For the primary variant, use the brand color for background (bg-brand from the Tailwind config), and define hover and disabled styles. For a secondary or outline variant, use appropriate styling (e.g. border with brand color, transparent background).
- [ ] Ensure the Button component uses the design tokens where applicable (for example, border-radius, font family, and font weight should correspond to the design system's guidelines).
- [ ] Create a Storybook story file Button.stories.tsx showcasing the Button component. Include stories for at least the primary variant (default), secondary variant, and a disabled state. Verify that the Button appears correctly in light and dark mode in Storybook.
- [ ] Create an Input component at src/components/ui/Input.tsx as a text input field (also a "use client" component). Include props such as placeholder, disabled, and any others needed for basic text input functionality.
- [ ] Style the Input using Tailwind classes to match the design system (e.g. add padding, border, rounded corners, and focus ring using the brand color). If the design calls for it, include a label and error message as part of the Input component composition.
- [ ] Create Input.stories.tsx to demonstrate the Input component in Storybook. Provide examples for a default state, a focused state (you can use Storybook's play function or controls to simulate focus), and a disabled state.
- [ ] Test both Button and Input in Storybook with the theme toggle to ensure their styles adapt correctly to dark mode (for example, if the Input uses a different background in dark mode or the Button's colors change).

### Story: Component Registry and Update Script
- [ ] Create a script (e.g. scripts/update-registry.ts) to maintain a component registry. This script should scan the src/components/ directory (and subfolders) for UI component files.
- [ ] In the registry script, collect the names of all component files (e.g. Button.tsx -> "Button") and update a registry JSON accordingly. For our project, we will integrate this with the design system config: the script should update the ui.config.json file's component list with all found components.
- [ ] Add a new npm script in package.json called "update-registry" that runs the registry update script (for example, using ts-node or a compiled JS file).
- [ ] Run npm run update-registry to generate or refresh the components list. It should read the current components (e.g. Button, Input) and update ui.config.json with these entries.
- [ ] Verify that after running the script, the ui.config.json file now contains an accurate list of components under its components section (and commit the updated config file).

### Story: Use of ui.config.json (ShadCN Format)
- [ ] Create a ui.config.json file in the root of the project to store the design system configuration (following a format similar to ShadCN UI's components.json). Include relevant fields such as:
  - Framework/library info (e.g. framework: Next.js/React, builder: Next.js, language: TypeScript).
  - Styling configuration (e.g. using Tailwind CSS v4, path to the Tailwind config, and global CSS).
  - Design token source and output (path to tokens.json and the generated theme.css file).
  - Font choices for the design system (e.g. "fontBody": "Plus Jakarta Sans", "fontHeadings": "Petrona").
  - Whether React Server Components (RSC) are used (for Next.js App Router, set this accordingly, e.g. rsc: true).
  - Ensure tsx: true since we use TypeScript/TSX for components.
  - The list of UI components in the design system (populate this with the component names like Button, Input – this may be updated by the registry script).
- [ ] Double-check that ui.config.json conforms to the expected structure and contains all necessary info for the design system. This config will serve as a single source of truth for the design system's setup (useful for automation or scripts in the future).
- [ ] Verify everything is consistent: run npm run build-theme and npm run update-registry once more to ensure that changes to tokens or components update the config, and that Storybook and the Next.js app reflect the latest theme and components properly. Commit the final configuration.
