# Storybook Design System

Welcome to our design system! This is a collection of reusable components, patterns, and guidelines that help us build consistent and high-quality user interfaces.

## Purpose

Our design system serves several key purposes:

- **Consistency**: Provides a single source of truth for UI components
- **Efficiency**: Speeds up development by reducing duplicate work
- **Quality**: Ensures components meet accessibility and usability standards
- **Collaboration**: Improves communication between designers and developers

## Core Principles

1. **Accessible by Default**: All components are built with accessibility in mind
2. **Flexible but Opinionated**: Components are customizable while maintaining consistency
3. **Performance First**: Optimized for speed and minimal bundle size
4. **Developer Experience**: Easy to use with great documentation and TypeScript support

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI for accessible primitives
- Next.js for the documentation site

## Maintainers

This design system is maintained by the UI Platform team. For questions or support:
